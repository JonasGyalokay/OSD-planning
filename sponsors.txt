Which exhibitors do we want?
Exhibitors can be divided into several different categories as seen from Open Source Days side.

We should try to get exhibitors from all the categories.

High paying exhibitors:
	Example: One.com has for a number of years been the main sponsor, often paying 100.000 DKK.

Influential exhibitors:
	Examples: Version2 and Prosa are both fairly influential in some circles and provide good advertising value for Open Source Days.

Interesting exhibitors:
	Open Source Days needs to continually renew itself with the changing times of the open source and general IT landscape.

	Examples: Composite (.NET based open source CMS system) and ministries dealing with open data, IT policies and so on.
