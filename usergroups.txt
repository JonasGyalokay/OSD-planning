Which user groups do we want?
User groups can be divided into several different categories as seen from Open Source Days side.

We should try to get user groups from all the categories.

Traditional unix user groups:
	Example: SSLUG or DKUUG or BSD-DK

User groups focused on single subjects:
	Example: Drupal Danmark or Copenhagen Perl Mongers

Groups sharing some of the open source concepts without neccessarily being about open source:
	Example: KanalTux or Labitat
